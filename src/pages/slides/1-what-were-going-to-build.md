Today we're going to build a simple (fake) UPC lookup service. The user will
enter a UPC barcode value to get information about the consumer product they
have scanned.

This presentation is based on a
[real UPC lookup service](https://community-garden-kitchen-barcodes.pages.dev/)
I created for the
[Community Garden Kitchen of McKinney](https://communitygardenkitchen.org/).

If you'd be sound kind as to make a
[donation](https://communitygardenkitchen.org/support/donate/), I would really
appreciate it.
