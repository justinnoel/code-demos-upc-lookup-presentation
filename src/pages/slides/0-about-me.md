## Cheesy 🧀 Bio

In 2013, I left my boring enterprise developer position in the telecom ☎ industry to jump into the exciting world of mobile app 📱 development. My own personal apps have not made me rich 😢 so, I've been a contract mobile app developer for many years, just finished working as a React Native developer for a major e-commerce company in the fashion industry 👗, and am now happily 😊 un(der)-employed and just enjoying dabbling with lots of new tech 👨‍💻.
