		In 2013, I left my boring enterprise developer position in the telecom ☎
		industry to jump into the exciting world of mobile app 📱 development.
	</p>

	<p class="p-common">
		Sadly, my own personal apps haven't made me rich <span class="not-sr-only"
			>😢</span
		>. To make ends meet, I've been an occasional contract mobile app developer
		and worked for a major e-commerce company.
	</p>

	<p class="p-common">
		Together with some great teams, I've built mobile apps for several Fortune
		100 companies.
	</p>

	<p class="p-common">
		Now, I'm happily <span class="not-sr-only">😊</span> un(der)-employed and just
		enjoying dabbling with lots of new tech 👨‍💻.
